Submitted Proposal:
- CRUD: Users have full shopping cart functionality: create/read/update/delete items in their cart

- Authentication: Users will be able to register, sign up, log in, log out, and create a profile with CRUD capabilities for this application. 

- API's: The main api will be interacting with the postgresql db. I will also be implementing paypal integration which should cover me for the 2nd, external api. 

- Pitch: This is a proof of concept for a generic eCommerce platform that could be used by any business with an online presence. This site will have an online catalog capable of housing a large inventory of products. There will be paypal integration and an admin panel for the site admin also.
